### Hello there, General Kenobi! 👋

My name is Jakub. I have many years of experience in the field of IT (+ 2 years of experience in WebDev). I’m studying Software Dev at WSB Gdańsk. Since I was a child, I’ve been dealing with technical-related things, which are my life’s „horse power”. For several years I’ve been interested in the WebDev solutions, of which I have commercial experience. I love working with people and projects in new technologies. I am fluent in English lang.

My current stack is HTML, CSS (SASS), JavaScript (ES6+) currently learning Vue.JS ecosystem and Strapi (Node.JS) as CMS. I've been working with many amazing people from whole Europe in these years, here you can check few of my favourite projects:
