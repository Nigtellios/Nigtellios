### Hello there, General Kenobi! 👋

My name is Jakub. I have many years of experience in the field of IT (+4 years of experience in WebDev itself). I’m studying Software Dev at WSB Gdańsk.

Since I was a child, I’ve been dealing with technical-related things, which are my life’s „horse power”. For several years I’ve been interested in the WebDev solutions, of which I have commercial experience. I love working with people and projects in new technologies. I am fluent in English lang. One of the most satisfying things while learning to program is that you always have something new to play with. 🐱‍👤

My current stack is TypeScript, Vue.JS, WebGL2 currently learning Nuxt ecosystem and Node.JS. In my free time I'm painting, 3D printing minifigures and building models.

I've been working with many amazing people from whole Europe in these years.
